# 387. First Unique Character in a String



class Solution {
public:
    int firstUniqChar(string s) {
        vector<int> freq(26,0);
        for(char c :s){
            freq[c-'a']++;
        }
        for(int i=0;i<s.size(); i++){
            if(freq[s[i]-'a']==1){
                return i;
            }
        }
        return -1;

    }
};


The firstUniqChar function finds the index of the first
 unique character in a string s. Here's  explanation:

1. Frequency Counting:
   Use a frequency array freq of size 26 (for lowercase letters)
   to count how often each character appears in s.

2. Find the First Unique Character:
   Iterate through s and check the frequency of each character
   in freq.

The first character with a frequency of 1 is the unique character, so return its index.

No Unique Character:

If no character has a frequency of 1, return -1.

Time Complexity: O(n)
