# 2351. First Letter to Appear Twice

class Solution {
public:
    char repeatedCharacter(string s) {
        vector<int> freq(26,0);
        for(char c: s){
            freq[c-'a']++;
            if(freq[c-'a']==2)return c;
        }
        return '\0';
    }
};


Here's explanation of the code:

Frequency Array: A vector freq[26] is used to track the occurrence
of each character ('a' to 'z') in the string s.

Iterate Through String: The loop goes through each character in 
the string, and for each character, its corresponding frequency is
incremented.

First Repeated Character: As soon as a character's frequency
reaches 2, it's returned as the first repeated character.

 If no character repeats, the function returns '\0' (null character).

Time Complexity: O(N)
Space Complexity: O(1)
This solution efficiently finds the first repeated character.
